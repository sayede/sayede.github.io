---
Adlane Sayede received his Ph.D. from Artois University (France) in 2003 for his contribution to the theoretical study of intercalation 
oxides. In 2005, he became "Ma&icirc;tre de Conf&eacute;rences" at Artois University where he completed his Habilitation in 2012. 
In 2010, he has received a Fellowship Award, from the DAAD, as researcher in the group of Prof. Michael Springborg at the University 
of Saarland (Germany). In 2016, he was promoted to full professor. His main area of research is theoretical studies of electronic and 
structural properties of materials, in particular ferroelectric/multiferroic oxides and intermetallic compounds for energy storage.
Thereby, his work is concentrate both on the development and on the application of new theoretical methods for treating new properties 
and/or systems as well as on applying existing methods. His work lies in an interdisciplinary area between chemistry and physics. 
Adlane SAYEDE is an associate editor of Open Physics, Degruyter Open Edition (formerly Central European Journal of Physics, 
Springer-Verlag Edition) since 2012. In 2016, he joined the Editorial board of de Frontiers in Chemistry, section: Theoretical and 
Computational Chemistry.
